# JS-Projects

Welcome to my **JS-Projects** repository! This repo documents my journey in learning JavaScript and building projects to improve my skills. Here, you'll find a collection of projects that showcase my progress, experiments, and learning experiences with JavaScript, along with supporting HTML and CSS.

## About

- **Purpose:** This repository is a personal portfolio of my growth as a JavaScript developer. It includes projects I created to practice, experiment, and understand core concepts in web development.
- **Technologies Used:**
  - **JavaScript** (44.8%): Main language for interactive and functional aspects of the projects.
  - **CSS** (29.5%): Styling and layout for the projects.
  - **HTML** (25.7%): Structure and markup for web pages.

## Projects

Each folder contains one or more projects, complete with source code, assets, and documentation as needed. These range from simple exercises to more complex applications.

## My Journey

This repository reflects my ongoing learning process. As I advance, I will continue to add new projects, improve existing ones, and apply new concepts.

Feel free to explore, give feedback, or use these examples for your own learning!
